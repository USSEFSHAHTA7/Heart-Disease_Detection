# Heart-Disease_Detection
ðŸ“Š Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection can save lives and reduce healthcare burdens. In this project, we use a supervised learning approach to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various health metrics.

This project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Training multiple ML Classifiers
- Evaluating performance using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix & ROC-AUC
- Model Deployment ready (pickle export)


Features include:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type (cp)
- Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
- Cholesterol (chol)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
- Resting ECG (restecg)
- Maximum Heart Rate (thalach)
- Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
- Oldpeak (ST depression)
- Slope of ST segment (slope)
- Number of major vessels (ca)
- Thalassemia (thal)
- Target: Presence of Heart Disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models Used
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
