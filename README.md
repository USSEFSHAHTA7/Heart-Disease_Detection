# Heart-Disease_Detection
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical parameters. It leverages supervised learning techniques to build a predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis.

üìù Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection through clinical data analysis can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This notebook demonstrates the process of:

Data preprocessing & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Model training using Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation of model performance

üìä Dataset
The dataset used is likely based on the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset or a similar structured dataset containing the following features:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure

Cholesterol Levels

Fasting Blood Sugar

Resting ECG Results

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved

Exercise-Induced Angina

ST Depression

Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment

Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy

Thalassemia

Target (Heart Disease Presence: 1=yes, 0=no)

Dataset Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Heart Disease Dataset (or your custom dataset).

üß† Machine Learning Model
Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

Steps:

Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values

Feature Scaling/Encoding (if required)
